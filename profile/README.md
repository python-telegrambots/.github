# Python TelegramBots

Why a package like this should even exsits? since there're a lot of python telegram bot packages ??!

1. To have a pure **wrapper** and a **framework** separatly which can also be installed together.
2. **Async** package.
3. Fully **strong typed** with **type hints** everywhere.
4. Simple and clean source.
5. For fun :)

_Most of all i like async and strong types._

- [Wrapper Repository](https://github.com/python-telegrambots/telegrambots) - [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/telegrambots/) (Required, lower level)
